Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href='https://www.is.ids.osaka-u.ac.jp'>IDS, Osaka University</a> where I work with Prof. Hajime Nagahara in the area of computational photography. Currently, I am working on  various problems involving deep optics and computational cameras such as human action recognition from coded exposure image and privacy-preserving cameras.

Before this, I earned my PhD in computer vision from IIT Gandhinagar in 2020. I was supervised by <a href='http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/'>Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman</a>. I was a TCS research fellow during my PhD. Before PhD, I earned my Integrated Dual Degree (BTech + Mtech) in computer science from IIT (BHU) Varanasi in 2014.
